Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The following are the steps performed to produce the tidy data set

1. Download unzipped files and write codes to unzip the files.
2. Load required data sets (features, activity_labels, and training & test set)
3. Rename the columns with the correct column names for both training and test data sets
4. Merge the three files for training set into 1 file. Do the same for the test set
5. Only focus on measurements that contain Mean and Standard Deviation
6. Also for variable names, change the abbreviations into a more appropriate name (for example, t into time, f into frequency, etc)
7. Product tidy data with the mean for all the measurements based on subjectID and activityID
8. Write the data set as output
